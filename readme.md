How to run the app:

1. clone the repository
2. "npm install" to install all the missing dependencies
3. run "npm run start" to start the app
4. have fun

File structure:

1. calculation.js - all the calculations after the initial inputs are done here
2. consts.js - some consts that are used across the app
3. index.js - main file, entry point
4. styles.css - styles for the app
5. validations.js - validation of all the user iput

TODO list:

1. deploy the app
2. refactor some of the code in validations.js and calculation.js, divide into smaller more readeable pieces
3. make more dynamic response to user actions (e.g. highlight the pressed buttons)
